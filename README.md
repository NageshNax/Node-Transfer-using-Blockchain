# Node Transfer – Blockchain Network Simulator

A visual and interactive **blockchain-based node-to-node data/message transfer simulator**.  
This project demonstrates how transactions move across nodes, how blocks are mined, and how a blockchain ledger is maintained — all inside a clean modern UI built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn-ui.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔗 Blockchain Features
- Genesis block generation
- Add new transactions between nodes
- Proof-of-work block mining (adjustable difficulty)
- Automatic block creation for valid transactions
- Chain verification (detect tampering or invalid hashes)
- Full ledger inspector (hash, nonce, timestamp, previous hash, route, etc.)

### 🌐 Node Network
- Visual network of nodes (N1 → N2 → N3 → N4 → N5)
- Select sender & receiver nodes
- Send message/data transactions
- Display message route inside the blockchain ledger

### 🖥️ Frontend (React)
- Modern UI using **shadcn-ui**
- TailwindCSS styling with dark mode
- Vite for super-fast local development
- Live blockchain dashboard:
  - Total Blocks  
  - Total Transactions  
  - Difficulty  
- Ledger UI with expandable blocks

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite  
- **UI:** TailwindCSS + shadcn-ui  
- **State / Logic:** Custom blockchain engine  
- **Tooling:** ESLint, PostCSS, Prettier
